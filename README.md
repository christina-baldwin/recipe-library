# js-project-recipe-library

# Functionalities implemented: all the requirements, the first 3 stretch goals plus the stretch goal of creating a "like recipes" functionality and a "favourite recipes" button that displays those liked recipes as well as being able to apply the same filters to the favourite recipes.

# deployed site: https://christinas-recipe-library.netlify.app/
